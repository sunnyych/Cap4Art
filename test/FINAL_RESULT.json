            "On the unusual arrangement of figures, Austrian-British art historian E. H. Gombrich writes:\n\nInstead of distributing his figures in equal pairs on both sides of the Madonna, he crammed a jostling crowd of angels into a narrow corner, and left the other side wide open to show the tall figure of the prophet, so reduced in size through the distance that he hardly reaches the Madonna's knee.",

            "Jesus is also extremely large for a baby, and he lies precariously on Mary's lap as if about to fall at any moment.",
            "The Madonna herself is of hardly human proportions\u2014",

            "Her right foot rests on cushions that appear to be only a few inches away from the picture plane, but the foot itself seems to project beyond it, and is thus on \"our\" side of the canvas, breaking the conventions of a framed picture.",
            "Her slender hands and long fingers have also led the Italian medical scientist Vito Franco of the University of Palermo to diagnose that Parmigianino's model had the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome affecting her connective tissue.",

            "Seen as a simple genre painting, it differs from most in that the boy is not 'rusticated,' that is, he is depicted as clean and well-dressed instead of as a 'cute' ragamuffin."

            "According to his contemporary Giulio Mancini he stayed for a short time with Monsignor Pandulfo Pucci in the Palazzo Colonna, but disliked the way Pucci treated him and left after a few months.",
            "(Pucci fed his boarders exclusively on greens, and Caravaggio referred to him later as 'Monsignor Salad').",
            "He copied religious pictures for Pucci, (none survive), and apparently did a few pieces of his own for personal sale, of which Boy Peeling a Fruit would be the only known example.",
            "The piece may also date from slightly later, when he was working for Giuseppe Cesari, the \"cavaliere d'Arpino\".",
            "As Caravaggio is said to have been painting only \"flowers and fruit\" for d'Arpino, this would again be a personal piece done for sale outside the workshop, but it was among the works seized from d'Alpino by Cardinal Scipione Borghese in 1607, together with two other early Caravaggios, the Young Sick Bacchus and the Boy with a Basket of Fruit.",
            "It is not known how these works came to be in Cesari's collection at the time.",
            "An allegoric meaning behind the painting is plausible, given the complex Renaissance symbology of fruit.",
            "Caravaggio scholar John T. Spike has recently suggested that the boy demonstrates resistance to temptation by ignoring the sweeter fruits (fruits of sin) in favour of the bergamot, but no specific reading is widely accepted.",
            "The model is thought to bear a resemblance to the angel in Caravaggio's Ecstasy of Saint Francis and to the boy dressed as Cupid on the far left in his Young Musicians, both about 1595 to 1597.",
            "Several other versions of the work are known, all of which may be by Caravaggio; it has been suggested that at the early stage of his career, while he was still in the studio of Cavalier d'Arpino, Caravaggio's paintings were put in the studio's shop window, and if they attracted the attention of passing buyers, Caravaggio would feed the demand with additional versions.",
            "In 1996 John T. Spike identified the likely original as a painting auctioned in London that year, although others have argued that either the Ishizuka version or that in the British Royal Collection could be the prototype.",
            "The version in the Royal Collection  has been on display in the Cumberland Gallery of Hampton Court Palace since 2004."

            "\"Not only was this painting more unequivocally classical in its pedigree (and recognized as such by critics who instantly dubbed it 'La Joconde cubiste') than any of its now relatively distant sources in Picasso's oeuvre,\" writes David Cottington, \"but in its clear if tacit juxtaposition, remarked on by Green and others, of sensation and idea\u2014taste and geometry",
            "it exemplified the interpretation of innovations from both wings of the cubist movement that Metzinger was offering in his essays of the time, as well as the paradigm shift from a perceptual to a conceptual painting that he recognized as now common to them.\"The quite atmosphere of Tea Time \"seduces by means of the bridge it creates between two periods\", according to Eimert and Podksik, \"although Metzinger's style had already passed through an analytical phase, it now concentrated more on the idea of reconciling modernity with classical subjects\".A preparatory drawing for Tea Time (Etude pour 'Le Go\u00fbter'), 19 x 15 cm, is conserved in Paris at the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne \u2013 Centre Georges Pompidou."

            "The oil-on-canvas was painted in memory of Bacon's lover George Dyer, who committed suicide on the eve of the artist's retrospective at Paris's Grand Palais on 24 October 1971.",
            "The triptych is a portrait of the moments before Dyer's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room.",
            "Bacon was haunted and preoccupied by Dyer's loss for the remaining years of his life and painted many works based on both the actual suicide and the events of its aftermath.",
            "He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered, describing the 1973 triptych as an exorcism of his feelings of loss and guilt.",
            "The work is stylistically more static and monumental than Bacon's earlier triptychs of Greek figures and friends' heads.",
            "It has been described as one of his \"supreme achievements\" and is generally viewed as his most intense and tragic canvas.",
            "Of the three Black Triptychs Bacon painted when confronting Dyer's death, Triptych, May\u2013June 1973 is generally regarded as the most accomplished.",
            "In 2006, The Daily Telegraph's art critic Sarah Crompton wrote that \"emotion seeps into each panel of this giant canvas ... the sheer power and control of Bacon's brushwork take the breath away\".",
            "Triptych, May\u2013June 1973 was purchased at auction in 1989 by Esther Grether for $6.3 million, then a record for a Bacon painting.",
            "Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, \"lovingly painted\", Dyer is by now clearly a broken man.",
            "The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, \"life seems to visibly drain ... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him\".",
            "Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl, though the object is not described.",
            "Schmied has proposed that in this frame the blackness of the background has enveloped the subject, and it \"seems to be advancing forward over the threshold, threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws.\"In the right panel, Dyer is shown with his eyes shut, vomiting into a hand basin.",
            "In the two outer frames his figure is shadowed by arrows, pictorial devices that Bacon often used to place a sense of energy into his paintings.",
            "In this work, the arrows point to a man about to die, and according to T\u00f3ib\u00edn they scream \"Here!\", \"Him!\".",
            "The arrow of the right panel, according to T\u00f3ib\u00edn, points to a \"dead figure on the lavatory bowl, as though telling the Furies where to find him\".",
            "The triptych is centralised by the lightbulb, and by the fact that Dyer faces inwards in the two outer canvasses.",
            "The triptych's composition and setting are poised to suggest instability, and the doors in each side panel are splayed outwards as if to look into the darkness of the foreground.",
            "Triptych, May\u2013June 1973 has been said to achieve its tension by locating voluptuously described figures in an austere, cage-like space.",
            "In 1975, the curator Hugh M. Davis noted that while Bacon's earlier triptychs had been set in public spaces \"open to all kinds of visitor\", the Black Triptychs are set in a \"deeply private realm, to which only the individual\u2014accompanied, perhaps, by one or two of his closest friends\u2014has access\".",
            "In 1999, Yard wrote that the sense of foreboding and ill-omen conjured by the Eumenides of Bacon's Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944) reappears in the triptych as a \"batlike void that snared the figure of George Dyer as he subsides into the supple curves of death\".",
            "John Russell observed that the painting's background describes an area which is half studio, half condemned cell.",
            "A reviewer of the 1975 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition found a resemblance between the concept of the central panel and Albrecht D\u00fcrer's engraving Melencolia",
            "I (1514)\u2014in the figure's pose, the bat form, and the panel's radiance\u2014suggesting that Bacon's late triptychs evoke \"memorable figural formulations\" of classic Western culture.",
            "Bacon later stated that \"painting has nothing to do with colouring surfaces\", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: \"When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work",
            "and then I go with the image itself.\"",
            "He told David Sylvester that he intended his \"hard, flat, bright ground\" to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that \"for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear.",
            "I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself\".",
            "Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with \"great energy\"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element.",
            "He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.",
            "Critics have argued whether the triptych should be read sequentially from left to right.",
            "Davies believes the work is a narrative, panoramic view of Dyer's suicide, and that the triptych's format implies a temporal continuity between each frame.",
            "Ernst van Alphen has argued that, notwithstanding spatial inconsistencies\u2014the light bulb featured in the central panel is missing from the two outer canvasses, while the doorway view is reversed in the center panel\u2014the triptych is a \"plain representation of a story\"."
